My foray into the world of coding!
This is my first exposure to Git and the beginning of my learning to code. It's something I've always wanted to do. Who knows I may even make some money at it! It's an exciting time to be learning with so many resources available to anyone who wants to learn. How could anyone not want to take advantage of these wonderful tools?
